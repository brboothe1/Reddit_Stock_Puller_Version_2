To do list, first notes from mentor:

1. Rebuild Order Class as an Interface
2. Restructure interaction with Stock and Order to make Order call Stock not Vice Versa
3. Rename limitOrder to value instead of limitOrder - The best documentation is Self Documentation
4. Rebuild marketOrder to take in current value of stock. (Auto Update)


To do tomorrow:
1. Figure out why it can't find the main class when I run.
2. Compose one stock and order with orders dependent on the stock class.


----------------3/17/19 Update ----------------

1. Optimized use of toString methods for limit orders nad market orders.
2. Improved access modifiers for variables in limit orders and market orders
